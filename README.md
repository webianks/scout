# Scout
Scout helps to perform email search flawlessly on the basis of extracting various email search parameters from plain english query.

# Problem
Email search on the mail server is based on explicitly providing input parameters like subject,
date, from, to etc.
Task is to translate a plain English based search text to the provided input set of
parameters.

**Example**
<ul>
<li>mails from ravi in the last 3 days —&gt; From:- Ravi, ToDate:- Today, FromDate:- Today-3days</li>
<li>ppts/presentations from ravi to me and rohan -- &gt; From:- Ravi To:-(Me and Rohan), AttachmentType:- ppt</li>
<li>all attachments larger than 3MB —&gt; AttachmentSize &gt; 3MB</li>
<li>Citrix XenMobile document -&gt; AttachmentType:- ppt/doc/xls/txt/pdf, AttachmentName :-Citrix/XenMobile/Citrix XenMobile </li>
</ul>


# Search sentences break-down
All the search sentences should be broken down to the following parameters.

<ol>
<li>From</li>
<li>To</li>
<li>ToDate</li>
<li>FromDate</li>
<li>HasAttachments</li>
<li>AttachmentType</li>
<li>AttachmentSize</li>
<li>AttachmentName</li>
<li>Subject</li>
<li>CC</li>
</ol>

#Solution

As we studied the problem statement, we came to find out that this can be achieved by <b>Natural Language Processing.</b> We looked through all the options for NLP and decided to go with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/in-en/marketplace/supervised-machine-learning" target="_blank"><b>IBM Watson Knowledge Studio</b></a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/alchemy-language.html" target="_blank"><b>IBM Alchemy Language API.</b></a>
For a particular language, we deal with finding the different <b>entities</b> in it, which is obtained by <b>training the model</b> accordingly in Watson Knowledge Studio. The model is trained by the different <b>annotations</b> provided by us to <b>recognize different entities</b> such as <b>Username</b>, <b>Time</b>, <b>Attachment</b>, <b>From</b>, <b>Subject</b> etc. We provide a generalized <b>training set</b> to the <b>model</b> to learn it, then <b>deploy the model to alchemy API service.</b>
From our <b>Android App</b>, we <b>input the file</b> and make call for each line to the alchemy service which has already be trained, this returns us with a <b>JSON response</b> containing the entities and the order which they we’re detected.
Now we <b>process</b> through those <b>obtained entities</b> in the App, for a <b>pattern</b> and <b>draw deductions</b> for the required parameters and write the <b>output in the file.</b>


**An Example of entity recognition and processing**
	PDFs from Ravi in the last 3 days
  
Entities are follows (JSON Response):
```json
"entities":[ 		
{
"count": "1",
"text": "PDF",
"type": "ATTACHMENT_TYPE"
},			
{
"count": "1",
"text": "from",
"type": "FROM"
},			{
"count": "1",
"text": "Ravi",
"type": "USERNAME"
},		
{
"count": "1",
"text": "last",
"type": "SPAN"
},		
{
"count": "1",
"text": "3 days",
"type": "DATE"  
} ]
```
